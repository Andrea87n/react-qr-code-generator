# React QR Code Generator 📱

A simple **QR Code Generator** built with **React** – a lightweight demo project designed to showcase React, state management, and local persistence.

This app integrates a few well-chosen libraries:
- **qrcode.react** for generating QR codes
- **TailwindCSS + DaisyUI** for styling and UI components

---

## ✨ Features
- Generate QR codes from any text or URL
- Download generated QR codes as **PNG**
- Save generated QR codes automatically in **localStorage**
- View a history of saved QR codes with previews
- Clear all saved QR codes in one click

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- React (with Vite)
- qrcode.react
- TailwindCSS + DaisyUI

---

## ⚠️ Note
This project is **for demonstration purposes only**.
The goal is to show how to combine React with UI libraries and persistence (via localStorage) to build a small but complete application.
